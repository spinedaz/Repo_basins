# Rivers and basins of Colombia 

This project is based on the one Created by Milo Popovic (https://github.com/milos-agathon/mapping-river-basins-with-r)

I also followed his detailed [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HugGwjogPv0)

If you are also a rookie like me trying to learn github follow this amazing [tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=jN6tvgt3GK8&t=0) where Mouna Belaid makes a step by step tutorial on how to start with R and github

To follow my code just download the basins and rivers from the links specified in the code and save them in the folder of your project.

The resulting map is this:
